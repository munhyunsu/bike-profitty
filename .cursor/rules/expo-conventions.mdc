## 1. Code Organization and Structure

Maintain a clean, scalable project structure.

*   **Start of source code:** `bike/`
*   **Root Structure:**
    *   `assets/`: Static assets (images, fonts).
    *   `src/`: All application logic.
        *   `src/app/`: Navigation of screens.
        *   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
        *   `src/screens/`: Top-level components representing distinct app views.
        *   `src/hooks/`: Custom React Hooks.
        *   `src/utils/`: Utility functions, constants.
        *   `src/services/`: API clients, data fetching logic.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **Files/Folders:** `kebab-case` for directories, `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for hooks/utils.
    *   **Components:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `HomeScreen.tsx`).
    *   **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `fetchData`).
    *   **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for global constants.
